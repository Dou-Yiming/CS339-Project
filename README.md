This is the project of SJTU-CS339-Computer Network. 

In this project, we propose and implement **light-U**, which is a novel mobile storage device based on Visible Light Communication (VLC).

Different from traditional mobile storage devices that use wires to transmit data, light-U only utilize visible light as transmission media. Therefore, compared with traditional devices, light-U boasts high safety, parallelism and privacy.

The structure of this project can be depicted by the following figure:

The final product using 3D printing technology:
